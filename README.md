# ⚽ Football Analytics  

Welcome to my **Football Analytics** repository! This is where I combine my two biggest passions: **Data Science** and **Football**, using analytical and machine learning techniques to gain deeper insights about the beautiful game.

## 📌 Projects  

### 🏹 xG Model (Expected Goals)  
A project focused on building an **xG (Expected Goals) model**, using machine learning techniques to predict the probability of a shot resulting in a goal.  

### 🏥 Injury Prevention & Prediction  
This project explores **injury prevention** in football by analyzing player workload, match intensity, and external factors to identify injury risks. It also implements **predictive modeling** to assess the likelihood of a player getting injured based on historical data.  

## 🚀 Future Plans  
- **Integrating Data Scraping** in my projects to make use of bigger and more extensive datasets  
- **Project exploring Player Transfer Values**, analyzing how player performance, age, and market trends impact valuations
